        <h2>Project: Anonymous Suggestion / Voting App</h2>
        <p>
          We are building an application where members of an organization can submit suggestions or feedback anonymously.
          Only users with an organization email (for example <strong>@sece.ac.in</strong>) can access the application. The identity of the submitter
          is stored for moderation/audit purposes only and is not shown inside the app. This allows honest feedback to surface while
          still allowing the organization to block misusers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Post anonymous suggestions (identity stored in a secure collection, not displayed)</li>
          <li>Vote on suggestions so important issues bubble up</li>
          <li>Abusive users can be identified by admins and blocked — the app doesn't show identity publicly</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-top:12px;">
          <button id="open-board">Open Suggestion Board</button>

        <h3>How it works (short)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sign in with your organization email (must end with <code>@sece.ac.in</code>).</li>
          <li>After sign-in you can open the suggestion board and post anonymously.</li>
          <li>Admins can find the user behind an abusive post via secure logs and restrict their access.</li>
